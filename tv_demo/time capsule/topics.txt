Topic 1:

Most of these images contain things that might have intrigued a young boy growing up alongside the internet.  These topics usually range from scouring the internet looking for flash games, or watching funny meme videos on youtube.  Some of these other images contain screenshots taken outside of internet browsers such as solitaire, or 3d pinball whenever the internet was down.  However, most of the images I have are about flash games from the later part of the 2000s and obscure internet jokes.  

Topic 2:

Some of the other photos I've collected focus less on the content that I viewed on the internet and more on the pieces and surrounding elements of my internet experiences as a young boy.  These pictures include fairly old operating software like iOS 6, and Windows Vista and XP, or older versions of youtube and copies internet explorer that were laden with add ons on top of add ons.
