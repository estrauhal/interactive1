  <h3>EIGHT YEARS OLD</h3>
  <h4>Poptropica was willed into existence around 2008, and I was just one of millions of kids who was hooked.</h4>
  <h5>Even though Poptropica is now available on smart devices everywhere, it began as a small flash game.</h5>

  <div id="square1" class="square">  <p>One flash game in particular that I remember spending a lot of time playing as a child was Poptropica. Poptropica was an online role-playing game where players can compete in multiplayer games but also communicate with each other through pre-selected dialogue options. Yup, Poptropica was the place to be if you were a child in the late 2000s.
